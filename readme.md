Intro
  I have been tasked to create a CV profile page about myself. The design of the page will match the existing design theme used by the academy and the site has also been designed to be responsive so that it can be used across different devices and screen sizes

Tech Used
  I used HTML and CSS to make this responsive CV site.

To access my CV, open the index.html file

Challenges
  The hardest challenge i encountered in this work is to align content, neatly and consistently. It was especially hard to work with images and to get the headshot as good as i wanted it.
